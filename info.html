                <p>Exoplanets are planets that are located outside of our solar system. In this page, you will learn about what makes an exoplanet habitable and get to experiment on changing factors to create your own explanet that may be capable of inhabiting aliens!</p>

                <h2>Radical Velocity Method</h2>
                <p>A planet orbiting a star can cause the star to wobble because of its gravity. We detect the "wobble of the star" applying a concpet called the "dopler shift".<br><br>Doppler shift can be seen in waves such as sound, light, and radio. For example, you may have experienced the pitch of the siren of the ambulance increasing as the ambulance approaches closer to you and decrease as it moves aways from you. That's the doppler effect! <br><br>Similarly, as the star wobbles closer and farther away from us, the shift of the lightwave occurs. When the light source moves away from us, the redshift occurs. Redshift is when the frequency of the light is more shifted to the color red. Blueshift is when the light moves towards us. Blueshift makes the frequency of the light closer to blue. Scientists detect the redshift and blueshift to detect the wobble of the star. </p>

                <h2>Transit Method</h2>
                <p>When the planet moves in front of the star, it slightly dims the brightness of the star. Telescopes detect the change of the brightness of the star.</p>
                <p>Below is data collected from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope: </p>

                <p>In this graph, the brightness of the star drastically decreases. This shows that planet is partially covering up the star, decreasing its brightness. This proves that the planet is orbiting the star!</p>

                <h2>Direct Imaging</h2>
                <p>Different from other methods, this method directly images the planet.</p>
                <p>Here is an example taken by JWST. Those are the actual images of exoplanets!</p>

                <h2>Gravitational Microlensing</h2>
                <p>When an exoplanet passes the star, the starlight is bent and focused. Telescopes detect this bending starlight to discover an exoplanet.</p>
                <p>This method is quite similar with the radial velocity method, but instead of doppler shift, it detects the wobble of the star's position relative to the other stars.</p>
